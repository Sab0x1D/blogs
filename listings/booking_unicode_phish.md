# Masquerading with ‚Äú„Çì‚Äù ‚Äî A Clever Unicode Trick in Booking.com Phishing Campaigns

> **Reference:** Original finding shared by [James (@JAMESWT_WT)](https://x.com/jameswt_wt/status/1955060839569870991?s=43&t=J_U8kMSz_93ikMaUjsdWnA) on X (formerly Twitter).

One of our malware hunter contacts, **James (@JAMESWT_WT)**, recently uncovered an elegant but dangerous phishing campaign in the wild.  
While phishing pages masquerading as **Booking.com** are not new, this one uses a **Unicode character swap** that‚Äôs subtle enough to evade casual detection.

## üïµÔ∏è The Masquerading Trick

The threat actor replaced the standard forward slash `/` in the URL path with the **Japanese hiragana character ‚Äú„Çì‚Äù (U+3093)**.  
Visually, in many fonts and browser address bars, this **looks similar enough** to a normal character separator ‚Äî but technically, it‚Äôs a completely different Unicode character.

This means that the malicious URL:

```
account.booking.com„Çìdetail„Çìrestric-access.www-account-booking.com/en/
```

is **not** the same as:

```
account.booking.com/detail/restric-access.www-account-booking.com/en/
```

The result?  
- **Security filters and regex-based detectors** tuned for ASCII `/` may fail to match.  
- End users **glance over the URL** and see nothing suspicious.  
- The page renders normally, further lowering suspicion.

## üìß Initial Lure ‚Äì The Phishing Email

The email lure is professionally done ‚Äî visually matching Booking.com‚Äôs branding, with an urgent **complaint notice** or **security alert**.  
Two examples observed:

1. **Fake Service Complaint Notice** ‚Äì claiming a guest lodged a complaint, urging the recipient to click a verification link.  
2. **New Device Login Alert** ‚Äì stating someone logged in from a suspicious location, prompting the user to ‚Äúterminate access.‚Äù

Both lead to the malicious domain with the embedded ‚Äú„Çì‚Äù character.

## üåê Observed Malicious Domains

| Domain | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `account.booking.com„Çìdetail„Çìrestric-access.www-account-booking.com/en/` | Primary phishing portal |
| `www-account-booking.com/c.php?a=0` | Likely credential harvesting or intermediate data handler |
| `updatessoftware.b-cdn.net/john/pr/04.08/IYTDTGTF.msi` | Malware payload delivery (MSI format) |

---

## üîç Technical Findings

The campaign does not stop at phishing credentials.  
The MSI payload (`IYTDTGTF.msi`) delivers a **HijackLoader** variant, further enabling the threat actor to deploy additional malicious modules.

From public threat intel sources, related samples show consistent tagging:

- **booking** (brand abuse)  
- **FakeCaptcha** (challenge page shown before final phishing page)  
- **HijackLoader** (payload)  
- File types: `.exe`, `.zip`, `.ps1`, `.msi`

Example VT/Tracker entries show:

| First Seen (UTC) | SHA256 | Tags |
|------------------|--------|------|
| 2025-08-12 00:15:02 | `3c123fbd4ae250a590093...` | booking, exe, FakeCaptcha |
| 2025-08-12 00:07:26 | `254c5fc795f3db647fcdb...` | booking, ps1, FakeCaptcha |
| 2025-08-06 20:35:19 | `caf3877f85e14b20b6484...` | HijackLoader, msi |

## üñ• Malware Behavior

Dynamic analysis of the MSI-delivered payload reveals:

- **File drop locations** within `%AppData%` and `%Temp%`
- Use of legitimate **Qt5Core.dll** and other Qt framework files to blend with legitimate software structures
- Network callbacks to C2 endpoints likely hosted behind CDN infrastructure
- Potential for credential theft and system reconnaissance

**Multi-stage attack chain:**
1. **Email lure ‚Üí Fake Booking.com page** (Unicode trick)  
2. **FakeCaptcha challenge** ‚Üí Credential harvest or payload trigger  
3. **MSI payload** ‚Üí HijackLoader  
4. **Loader** ‚Üí Further malicious modules

## ‚ö† Why the Unicode Slash Trick Matters

This ‚Äú„Çì‚Äù replacement is particularly dangerous because:

- Most security awareness training **teaches users to check the domain**, but not the characters between path segments.
- Filtering systems looking for `/`-separated patterns may **completely miss it**.
- Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) have been abused before with homograph attacks, but **path-level Unicode swaps** are less discussed.

---

## üõ° Detection & Mitigation

**For defenders:**
- Normalize and sanitize URLs before scanning ‚Äî convert Unicode characters to their ASCII equivalents where applicable.
- Add YARA/SIGMA rules to detect suspicious Unicode in URL paths.
- Educate users that **odd characters in URLs are a red flag**, even after the domain.

**For users:**
- Do not click links in unsolicited Booking.com (or any service) emails.
- Always navigate to the site manually by typing the URL into the browser.
- Enable MFA where possible.

## üèÅ Conclusion

James‚Äôs find is a reminder that **attackers keep innovating at the smallest detail level** ‚Äî in this case, swapping a single character for a visually similar Unicode equivalent.

This campaign blends:
- Social engineering  
- Unicode obfuscation  
- Brand impersonation  
- Multi-stage malware delivery  

‚Ä¶into a single, well-crafted operation.

Stay alert ‚Äî and remember, in cybersecurity, **every character counts**.
