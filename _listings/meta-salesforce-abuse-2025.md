## Introduction

A new phishing wave has been observed abusing **Salesforce’s Marketing Cloud infrastructure** to impersonate **Meta Business Support**.  
The emails, which appear professional and credible, claim that the recipient’s *Meta Ad Account has been temporarily restricted* due to advertising policy violations.  

This campaign demonstrates a dangerous evolution in phishing tactics — attackers no longer rely solely on compromised web servers, but instead **leverage legitimate enterprise tools like Salesforce** to host and distribute their malicious redirects.

---

## Anatomy of the Phishing Email

The lure arrives as a seemingly authentic support notification:

> **Subject:** Temporary changes to your ad account – [Ticket ID: FBC7832HS721]  
> **From:** Juan Ch. <jchavezmagana@salesforce.com>  
> **Sent via:** Salesforce Marketing Cloud (e360.salesforce.com)

![Salesforce Lure Email]({{ '/assets/img/banners/salesforce_lure_email.png' | relative_url }}){: .img-center }

The message warns the user that their business ad account has been “temporarily restricted” and lists possible reasons, such as:

- Repeated ad disapprovals or ongoing policy violations  
- Use of misleading content or targeting  
- Links to restricted accounts  

It then urges the recipient to review the restriction via the embedded “Business Support Center” link — visually a **Facebook URL**, but underneath, a **Salesforce tracking redirect**.

---

## Abusing Trusted Salesforce Infrastructure

The embedded links follow patterns such as:

```
https://8tgtt5[.]2.tracking[.]e360.salesforce[.]com/click?jwf=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1Qi...
```

![Salesforce Embedded Link]({{ '/assets/img/banners/salesforce_embedded_link.png' | relative_url }}){: .img-center }

These are genuine Salesforce-hosted tracking URLs — part of the company’s marketing automation framework — but in this case, hijacked to deliver a **malicious redirect**.  

This technique offers attackers multiple advantages:

1. **Domain Trust** – `salesforce.com` is globally whitelisted by most email gateways.  
2. **SSL Certificate Validity** – Ensures HTTPS padlock legitimacy.  
3. **Tracking Redirects** – Allow seamless concealment of the true destination.  
4. **High Deliverability** – Emails from Salesforce infrastructure often evade spam filters.

In short, attackers weaponize Salesforce’s own trust and deliver phishing traffic under the guise of legitimate customer communications.

---

## The Fake Meta Support Portal

Clicking the Salesforce link redirects victims to a **spoofed Meta Support portal** hosted on a fraudulent domain:

![Meta Support Portal]({{ '/assets/img/banners/meta_support_portal.png' | relative_url }}){: .img-center }

The site is a near-perfect clone of Meta’s real business help interface, including:

- A *“Content Reports Against You”* dashboard  
- Fake case IDs (e.g., FBC7832HS721)  
- Buttons for *“View all ongoing cases”* and *“Open New Case”*  
- Meta logos, typography, and tone matching the genuine support environment

Once the victim selects “Contact Support,” a modal appears requesting their **name, business email, and confirmation checkbox**.  
This data is silently exfiltrated to an attacker-controlled backend.

![Meta Support Modal]({{ '/assets/img/banners/meta_support_modal.png' | relative_url }}){: .img-center }

## Technical Breakdown

### **Observed Redirect Chain**

| Stage | Domain | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | `salesforce.com` | Abused legitimate tracking domain |
| 2 | `metasupport-center[.]com` | Fake Meta portal for data collection |
| 3 | [hidden backend endpoint] | Captures submitted credentials |

### **Example Email Structure**
- **Display Name:** Juan Ch.  
- **Envelope Domain:** salesforce.com  
- **Reply-To:** Empty or mismatched  
- **Message-ID:** Salesforce Marketing Cloud format  
- **URLs:** Redirect via `e360[.]salesforce.com`  

---

## The Psychological Hook

The content leverages **authority and urgency**, two of the strongest social engineering triggers:

- **Authority:** Uses official Meta branding, ticket numbers, and corporate tone.  
- **Urgency:** Threatens advertising suspension and limited access.  
- **Familiarity:** Meta advertisers often deal with legitimate policy reviews, making the scenario believable.  

This perfect storm of trust signals makes the email remarkably effective at bypassing human suspicion.

---

## Why Salesforce Is a Prime Target

Salesforce Marketing Cloud enables organizations to send large volumes of legitimate customer communications. However, when an account is **compromised or misused**, its reach and reputation amplify the impact of phishing.

Key reasons attackers exploit it:

1. **Trusted Domains** – Rarely flagged by filters.  
2. **Scalable Email Infrastructure** – Can send high volumes efficiently.  
3. **Built-in Redirection** – Perfect for concealing phishing endpoints.  
4. **Complex Tenant Ownership** – Makes abuse difficult to attribute or remediate quickly.  

This represents a growing class of threat known as **“SaaS abuse phishing.”** Attackers no longer host malicious payloads on sketchy servers — they **weaponize legitimate SaaS ecosystems**.

---

## Real-World Implications for Victims

For digital marketing teams and small businesses, the fallout can be severe:

- **Credential Theft:** Business account login data harvested.  
- **Ad Account Hijacking:** Attackers run fraudulent ads using stolen funds.  
- **Brand Reputation Damage:** Compromised accounts distribute scams or malware.  
- **Recovery Delays:** Meta account restoration can take weeks, disrupting campaigns and analytics.

In one captured session, the fake portal’s form data submitted “John Doe / notreal@notreal.com” — confirming the page’s data capture function works regardless of input validity.

## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

**Domains and URLs:**
```
https://8tgtt5[.]2.tracking[.]e360.salesforce[.]com/click?jwf=...
https://metasupport-center[.]com/?fstoken=...
```

**Email Subject:**
```
Temporary changes to your ad account – [Ticket ID: FBC7832HS721]
```

**Spoofed Sender:**
```
Juan Ch. <jchavezmagana@salesforce.com>
```

**Observed Host:**
```
metasupport-center[.]com (registered October 2025)
```

---

## Detection and Mitigation

1. **Hover Before Clicking**  
   Verify URLs by hovering over them — if the visible text differs from the actual link, treat it as suspicious.

2. **Authenticate Directly**  
   Access Meta Business Support only through:
   [https://business.facebook.com/business/help](https://business.facebook.com/business/help)

3. **Report Abuse**  
   Salesforce users should forward such emails to:  
   **abuse@salesforce.com**  
   Meta-related phishing can be reported via:  
   **phish@fb.com**

4. **Enforce MFA**  
   Enable multi-factor authentication on all Meta Business accounts.

5. **Educate Marketing Teams**  
   Run awareness sessions focusing on SaaS-based phishing tactics.

## Lessons from This Campaign

This phishing wave showcases a refined attack chain built on **legitimacy, trust, and automation**:

- Trusted SaaS (Salesforce) abused for redirection.  
- Recognizable brand (Meta) impersonated for credibility.  
- Professional UI (fake portal) used for harvesting.  

It’s a stark reminder that **security by reputation is no longer reliable**. Even the world’s most trusted enterprise platforms can become tools of deception when compromised or misused.

---

## The Bigger Picture

As organizations move their marketing and communication pipelines into the cloud, attackers follow.  
The **Salesforce–Meta phish** highlights how threat actors adapt to digital ecosystems faster than traditional defenses can respond.  

Defending against this new generation of phishing requires visibility across SaaS services, adaptive threat intelligence, and continuous employee education.

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Salesforce infrastructure is being abused** to deliver Meta phishing campaigns.  
- **Legitimate SaaS trust** can be exploited to bypass filters and fool users.  
- **Attackers rely on visual precision** and business familiarity rather than malware.  
- **Verification through official dashboards** is the safest path.  
- **Awareness training** is still the most cost-effective defense.
